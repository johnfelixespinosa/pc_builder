### Contributing
  Contributing to this project is easy and as transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Github
  I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
  Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
  Use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

### Purpose
  This Rails application allows users to plan and create new computer builds. A user can create parts lists, which then allows them to create builds using those parts lists. A user can add images to their builds. There is support for liking and commenting on other users builds. A user can explore all the builds on the site and they can be sorted by newest, oldest, or most liked.
